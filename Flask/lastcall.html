'I stopped watching after about 30 minutes. You can not watch anything anymore without having the whole Leftist agenda jammed down your throat. Justin Timberlake, went to the slammer and has to take a menial job, that fits the current Leftist agenda of not putting anyone in jail. Then we have the whole gender confusion issue with the kid, and the white people people in totality being insensitive hillbillies, other than Timberlake who is just too cool. Everything has to be political now even a mediocre movie, that might have been good without the hidden messages.'
'This is a display of how to be an irresponsible parent. Your boy is a boy, stop this crazy nonsense. -100,000 out of 10.'
"This is ridiculous on so many levels, I don't even know where to start. Save yourself from the embarrassment of watching this garbage and move on to a real film."
'Genuinely terrible. Justin cannot act. Please stop hiring him. This was a paint by numbers performance and I would not recommend.'
"I'm a huge Apple fan but they really need to step up their game on Apple TV. I get they are trying for a positive vibe but this is a death sentence if they don't change."
"Don't waste your time\nIt was very boring movie\nThe story is bad the it was just wast of good weekend"
"This is unwatchable. But again I am not surprised as it is coming from woke Apple. After Tim Cook came, this company is reaching record low in terms of respect, brand, etc.\nIf you are a woke nutcase, you'll find this movie awesome, as scoring social points are more important than recognizing that this movie is a complete trash.", 'Another year with dumb woke movies.\nSad. Really sad'
'After 20 minutes had to fast forward to find somethingg worth watching - but all I found was woke leftist rubbish. The acting was OK, the directing was adequate, but the script was total rubbish. Dont waste your time or money.'
'Follows the formula that most white people are variations of bad, with the cops being the worst. The only good people are the excon (Timberlake), the LGBTQ young boy, and the teacher and janitor that happen to be black. The acting is decent throughout but the actors are held back by the terrible script and all of the contrived situations. The plots seems like it was following a lifetime channel checklist for a sappy story. A southern setting? Check. Excon who has a big heart and just made a mistake when he was young? Check. A trailer trash meth addict mom? Check. Intolerant cops, church goers, and employers? Check. Incompetent social workers? Check.', 'This movie fails to impress. The viewer keeps expecting something interesting to happen, but it just drones on.'
"Great movie of you love the agenda of left. Other than that it's hard to watch. Slow, predictable, and boring."
'Very bad film nothing interesting to watch. Justin is always a good actor but the scenario is not good.'
